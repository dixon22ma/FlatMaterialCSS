Kanboard Flat Material Theme
============================

Style for https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard

This plugin converts the Kanboard visuals in a flat theme based on Google Material concepts.
I would like to thank ``TTJ`` for his ``Kanboard CSS`` plugin (which I can't seem to find on Github anymore).

Now his styling is integrated in this plugin and you can modify the styling by modifying the ``SASS`` files in the
``sass``  folder. These files have to be compiled in the ``css`` folder. A good starting point is to have a look at 
the ``variables.sass`` file, where most individual settings can be modified. I believe that the tag names mostly speak
for themselves.
